# Production requirements

## Infrastructure release readiness

This section is the release-engineering boundary. It can be completed before
the application backlog is complete, but only with attached workflow, backup,
restore and smoke-check evidence. The release source is `wordpress`: a push
deploys the immutable artifact to staging, while production receives the same
artifact only through a manually approved GitHub Environment deployment.

- [ ] GitHub `staging` and `production` Environments contain SSH host, user,
  port, release root, WordPress root, deploy key and pinned `known_hosts`.
- [ ] Staging is `https://staging.logika.resumemyhost.miy.link`, has its own
  database and files, serves HTTPS and is non-indexable.
- [ ] The managed `wp-content` symlink targets the complete
  `DEPLOY_ROOT/current/wordpress/wp-content` tree; do not deploy selected
  themes/plugins or static build overlays. Only uploads, `wp-config.php` and
  database content stay outside the release payload.
- [ ] The staging workflow has deployed a validated SHA and its smoke checks
  have passed.
- [ ] If a local WordPress database snapshot is needed on staging, it is
  exported with `scripts/release/export-local-staging-db.sh`, uploaded only to
  `DEPLOY_ROOT/incoming/staging-db.sql.gz`, imported only by the staging
  workflow, and followed by staging noindex/smoke evidence.
- [ ] The production Environment requires an approver and deploys only an
  artifact downloaded from a successful staging workflow run.
- [ ] A protected database plus managed-files backup is created before each
  production deploy, retained for 30 days, and has been restored on staging.
- [ ] The preceding release is still present and its rollback has been drilled
  on staging within 30 minutes.
- [ ] The release initiator has reviewed nginx/PHP/WordPress logs, 404s and
  the lead queue during the first 24 hours after production deployment.

## Application go-live readiness

The remaining product requirements below are intentionally not evidence of
infrastructure readiness. Leave them unchecked until the related CRM, import,
redirect, SEO, content and dynamic-page functionality has been implemented and
verified for a public launch.

The operational setup and evidence collection procedure is documented in
[`release-operations.md`](release-operations.md).

## 5. CI/CD and automated deployment

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is configured before connecting real production hosting.
- [ ] Pipeline runs automatically on pull requests.
- [ ] Pipeline runs automatically on pushes to the main deployment branch.
- [ ] Autodeploy is configured for staging from the approved deployment branch.
- [ ] Production deployment is gated by successful CI checks.
- [ ] Production deployment requires explicit approval until the hosting and rollback process are proven stable.
- [ ] Deployment is blocked when any required test/check fails.
- [ ] Pipeline installs dependencies from lockfiles only.
- [ ] Pipeline builds frontend assets with the approved Node/npm stack.
- [ ] Pipeline validates PHP code when WordPress plugin/theme code is present.
- [ ] Pipeline runs unit tests when available.
- [ ] Pipeline runs integration tests when available.

- [ ] Pipeline runs HTML validation or documents known accepted failures.
- [ ] Pipeline verifies that no production secrets are present in the repository or build artifact.
- [ ] Pipeline uploads or exposes build logs for debugging failed deployments.
- [ ] Failed deployments do not modify production state.
- [ ] Deployment status is visible to the team.

Required CI checks before any autodeploy:

- [ ] Frontend build passes.

- [ ] Integration tests pass where available.

Autodeploy policy:

- [ ] Production deploy should use the same reviewed artifact that passed CI.
- [ ] Production deploy should have rollback steps linked in the pipeline or release notes.

## 6. Database and migrations

  automatic database import from local snapshots.
